# **DEPECIATED**

This module is currently depreciated and has moved to https://github.com/makersacademy/stream_processing


# Data Streaming

In this module you will learn about:

* Sub Pub systems like Kafka.
* Streaming with PySpark.
* Create dashboards that answer business questions.

You will achieve these by working through a sequence of exercises and
challenges.

We'll be using a technology called Docker to run everything locally, it's
important not to delete anything as we'll continue building on what we've
already made each day.

## Module Sequence

Work through each of these phases in sequence.

Some of these challenges include [submissions](./01_spark/05_spark_assessment.md) in which you share some of
your work with a coach for feedback. These are tagged with a 📡.

### Phase Zero: Introduction
An introduction to data modeling.

1. [Introduction to the module](./00_introduction/01_introduction.md)
2. [Docker Set Up](./00_introduction/02_docker_set_up.md)

### Phase One: Spark

These exercises build up your understanding Spark and PySpark.

1. [Spark Architecture](01_spark/01_architecture.md)
2. [The Spark API](01_spark/02_spark_api.md)
3. [Spark Coding](01_spark/03_spark_coding.md)
4. [Advanced Spark](01_spark/04_advanced.md)
5. [Assignment](01_spark/05_spark_assessment.md) 📡

### Phase Two: Kafka

Here you'll take a look at Kafka.

1. [Introduction](02_kafka/01_intro.md)
2. [Pub Sub](02_kafka/02_pub_sub.md)
3. [Data](02_kafka/03_data.md)
4. [Misc](02_kafka/04_odds_and_ends.md)
5. [Topics](02_kafka/05_topics.md)

### Phase Three: Spark Streaming

Here we'll start to get into streaming.

1. [Introduction](03_spark_streaming/00_intro.md)
2. [Python Practice](03_spark_streaming/01_python_practice.md)
3. [Spark Practice](03_spark_streaming/02_spark_practice.md)
4. [Streaming](03_spark_streaming/03_start_streaming.md)
5. [More Streaming](03_spark_streaming/04_more_streaming.md)
6. [JSON With Kafka](03_spark_streaming/05_json_input_output.md) 📡
7. [UDFs](03_spark_streaming/06_udf.md)

### Phase Four: Streaming Continued

Here we'll start to get into streaming, and start tracking monsters.

1. [More Advanced Streaming Topics](04_streaming_continued/01_streaming_detailed.md)
2. [Streaming Examples](04_streaming_continued/02_streaming_examples.md)


### Phase Five: Assessment

Follow on from 04, chasing monsters and seeing what damage they've caused.

1. [Assessment](05_assessment/01_assessment.md) 📡
